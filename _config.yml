  Hi, my name's Leigh and I'm a Software Developer.

  With nearly 30 years' experience in the industry, I've been working in the New Zealand IT community for 17 years, including the last 14 as a business owner and contractor.

  I mainly work in the <mark>DotNet</mark> and <mark>GIS</mark> spaces, and have strong interests in data visualisation and communication. I also design and develop software for <mark>embedded</mark> devices for data acquisition.

  If you would like to read a more in-depth story about me, here's an [article](https://venari.co.nz/about/).

          Originating as a tool for creating long term off-grid timelapses of construction and infrastructure projects spanning months or years, this became a platform for remote imagery acquisition.
          Several of these cameras have been used in the field for a year by a Council for near realtime remote collection of evidence of waterway pollution.

          Using a Raspberry Pi, Pi Juice and solar power, these devices can run for months or years without external power, and send telemetry and imagery to a central server ensuring that in the event of theft, imagery is preserved.

          Offered both as open-source software and hardware with option for self-hosting, and as a managed service to construction industry and enforcement agencies in New Zealand.
