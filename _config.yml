  Hi, my name's Leigh and I'm a Software Developer.

  With nearly 30 years' experience in the industry, I've been working in the New Zealand IT community for 17 years, including the last 14 as a business owner and contractor.

  I mainly work in the <mark>DotNet</mark> and <mark>GIS</mark> spaces, and have strong interests in data visualisation and communication. I also design and develop software for <mark>embedded</mark> devices for data acquisition.

  If you would like to read a more in-depth story about me, here's an [article](https://venari.co.nz/about/).

          Originating as a tool for creating long term off-grid timelapses of construction and infrastructure projects spanning months or years, this became a platform for remote imagery acquisition.
          Several of these cameras have been used in the field for a year by a Council for near realtime remote collection of evidence of waterway pollution.

          Using a Raspberry Pi, Pi Juice and solar power, these devices can run for months or years without external power, and send telemetry and imagery to a central server ensuring that in the event of theft, imagery is preserved.

          Offered both as open-source software and hardware with option for self-hosting, and as a managed service to construction industry and enforcement agencies in New Zealand.

            In addition to Drone photography and videography, I initiated and refined a drone hyperlapse creation service to help organisations communicate progress of their projects to stakeholders and the public.
            By aligning and stitching together multiple captures of a site, we create a seamless story to show the progression of projects across many months or years.

            I give IT support and advice to a local Women's Refuge Service in Porirua. 
            In addition to general IT support and procurement assistance, I migrated their office environment to Office 365 and helped migrate systems and records to the cloud.

            I founded the Porirua CoderDojo, part of a global collection of free clubs inspiring and teaching children aged 5-15 about coding. 
            We used the graphical programming language Scratch for beginners and JavaScript and Arduino for older kids to expose young inquisitive minds to programming and computational thinking.
